First project... ever!
I always liked figuring how things worked, step by step, that's why learning to code was in the back of my mind for quite some time. 
It seems like an interesting mix of problem solving skills with learning a new "language". 
It has a creative aspect to it, which I'm missing in my current proffession.
This coding challenge gave me a push to take the first step and finally do it!
